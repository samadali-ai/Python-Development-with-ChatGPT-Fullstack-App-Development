# News Aggregator Flask Application

## Overview

This Flask application is a news aggregator that fetches and displays top news headlines using the News API. It supports pagination and topic filtering. 

## Features

- **Pagination**: View news articles across multiple pages.
- **Topic Filtering**: Filter news articles by category.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Requests
- Ngrok

## Getting Started

### 1. Set Up Your Environment

#### Install Python Dependencies

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install flask requests
   ```

### 2. Obtain and Set Up Ngrok

#### Create an Ngrok Account

1. Visit the [Ngrok website](https://ngrok.com/).
2. Click "Sign Up" and create an account using your email or Google/GitHub.
3. Verify your email if you signed up with an email address.

#### Download and Install Ngrok

1. Log in to your Ngrok account.
2. Download Ngrok for your operating system from the [Ngrok download page](https://ngrok.com/download).
3. Extract the downloaded file:
   - **Windows**: Move `ngrok.exe` to a directory (e.g., `C:\ngrok\`) and add it to your system's PATH.
   - **macOS/Linux**: Move `ngrok` to `/usr/local/bin` or another directory in your PATH.

#### Authenticate Ngrok

1. From the Ngrok dashboard, copy your authentication token.
2. Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   ngrok authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN` with the token from your Ngrok dashboard.

### 3. Configure and Run the Flask Application

1. **Set Up Your Flask App:**
   - Ensure your Flask app is saved as `app.py` or a similar name.
   - The `NEWS_API_KEY` is hardcoded in this example. For security, consider loading it from an environment variable using `python-dotenv`.

2. **Run the Flask Application:**
   - Navigate to the directory containing your Flask application.
   - Start the Flask development server:
     ```bash
     flask run
     ```
   - By default, Flask will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### 4. Expose Your Local Server with Ngrok

1. **Start Ngrok:**
   - Open a new terminal window.
   - Run Ngrok to expose your Flask application:
     ```bash
     ngrok http 5000
     ```
     Replace `5000` with the port number your Flask app is running on if different.

2. **Access Your Application:**
   - Ngrok will provide a public URL (e.g., `http://randomstring.ngrok.io`).
   - Use this URL to access your Flask application from the internet.

### 5. Testing the Application

1. Open a web browser and visit the Ngrok URL provided by Ngrok.
2. Verify that your application is functioning as expected:
   - Check that you can view news articles.
   - Test pagination and topic filtering functionalities.

## Additional Notes

- **Ngrok Dashboard:** Access the Ngrok web-based dashboard at `http://localhost:4040` to monitor and inspect your traffic.
- **Deployment:** Ngrok is useful for development and testing. For production deployments, consider using cloud services or dedicated servers.
